Deflickering a time-lapse video involves reducing or eliminating the variations in brightness or exposure that can occur between individual frames, resulting in a flickering effect. This can happen due to changes in lighting conditions, automatic exposure adjustments, or other factors. Here's how you can deflicker a time-lapse video using software like EzTimelapse:

1. Import Your Time-Lapse Sequence:

 * Open EzTimelapse and import your time-lapse photo sequence into the Photo-List on left.

2. Enable Deflicker:

 * Switch to enable Deflicker module.

3. Adjust the smooth param:

 * 20 is the maxium smooth strength

4. Output Settings:

 * Select the export resolution. Max video supports 3840x2160px.
 * Select the video fps.

5. Export Your Sequence:

 * Once you're satisfied with the adjustments, export your time-lapse sequence as a video file or processed images.
