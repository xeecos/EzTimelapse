Time-lapse photography is a technique in which a series of photos are taken at regular intervals over a period of time and then played back at a faster speed, creating the illusion of time passing quickly. This technique is often used to capture slow processes that are not easily noticeable in real-time, such as the movement of clouds, the blooming of flowers, or the construction of buildings.

To create a time-lapse video, a camera is set up on a stable surface or a tripod, and it captures images at predefined intervals, such as every few seconds or minutes. These images are then compiled into a video using specialized software. The interval between shots and the total number of frames captured determine the speed at which the final time-lapse video will play.

Time-lapse photography allows viewers to witness events that unfold over a long period of time in just a few minutes or seconds, providing a unique perspective on the passage of time. It is commonly used in filmmaking, documentary production, scientific research, and creative photography projects.
