You can convert an image sequence——a set of sequentially numbered or named images—to a movie or time-lapse video in QuickTime Player.

* In the QuickTime Player app  on your Mac, choose File > Open Image Sequence.

* Select the image sequence folder in the Finder, then click “Choose media.”

 You can choose to select specific images and not the entire folder.

* Set the movie quality.

 To keep or change the quality of the image sequence, choose any of the following options in the image sequence pop-up menu:

 * Resolution: Choose the frame size.

   Depending on the video format, some frame sizes may not be available.

 * Frame Rate: Choose the number of frames per second (fps).

 * Encode For: Choose from Greater Compatibility (H.264), Better Compression (HEVC), and Higher Quality (ProRes).

* Click Open.

 The movie or time-lapse video opens in a new window.
